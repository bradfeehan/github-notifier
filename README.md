# What the use of this branch???

This branch is the development branch for gitdocs pages. The pages in *.md format are stored here.

Every time pages will be modified here ```gitdocs build``` needs to be executed in gitdocs_root folder. The resulting pages needs to be placed in documentation folder of gh-pages branch

**NOTE:** Because of limitations (bugs?) in gitdocs images needs to be referenced here, but added directly in gh-pages branch. Also, hyperlinks needs to be fixed after each build
