As is shown in the screenshot the extension shows the repository name, Pull request/Issue name and why the notifications is shown. After clicking on the extension you will go to the Pull request/Issue.\n\n<img src=\"Notifier%20for%20GitHub%20Chrome%20extension%20notification.png\" alt=\"Notifier for GitHub\">\n\n## RSS Notifications from github\n\nUsers can enable RSS feeds from github.com or Github Enterprise server by clicking to \"Subscribe to your news feed\" as shown below.
